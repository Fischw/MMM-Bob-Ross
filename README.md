# MMM-Bob-Ross
![Demo1](https://i.imgur.com/gIFZl54.gif)<br/>
Why not put a happy little cabin on your happy little [MagicMirrorÂ²](https://github.com/MichMich/MagicMirror)?
Bob Ross is the quintessential wholesome TV guy, so I thought it was time for him to make his debut on the silver screen... or reflective screen I guess. <br/><br/>
Displays a random Bob Ross painting when started, but can also play the episode where he paints it.
To display the video, another module must send a notification with ``ROSS_PLAY_VIDEO`` and to switch back they must send ``ROSS_SHOW_IMAGE``. More information on all notifications below.

## Installation
Navigate to the modules folder of your Magic Mirror installation.
```bash
cd ~/MagicMirror/modules
```

Clone the repository.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Veldrovive/MMM-Bob-Ross.git
```

        videoHeight: "30vh", //Same as above. Defines the height of the video
        updateInterval: 1*60*60*1000, //How often does the painting change?
